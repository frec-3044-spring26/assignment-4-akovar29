- No Credit: No plot provided

Question 2:

- Full Credit: Answer is correct given the slope in the plot from question 1.  A justification is provided.

- Partial Credit:  Answer is correct given the slope in the plot from question 1 but no justification is provided OR answer is not correct

- No Credit: No answer provided

Question 5:

- Full Credit: add_predictions and add_residuals are correctly used.

- No Credit: No code provided OR add_predictions and/or add_residuals are incorrectly used.

Question 6:

- Full Credit:  Histogram with residual on the x-axis Axes labeled.  Uses ggplot and correct geom.  Provides answer about meeting normally distribution error assumption.

- Partial Credit: Plot has incorrect axes values, labels, did not use ggplot, incorrect geom, or other issues. OR no answer about meeting normally assumption

- No Credit: No plot and answer provided

Question 7:

- Full Credit: Correct p-value is provided given the regression fit.  

- No Credit: Incorrect p-value is provided given the regression fit 

Question 8:

- Full Credit: Correct calculation of the number of years required to lose 1 week of ice.  A response is provided about the meaningfulness of the answer.

- Partial Credit: Incorrect calculation of the number years required to lose 1 week of ice OR no response provided about the meaningfulness of the answer.

- No Credit: No code and answer provided

Question 9:

- Full Credit: Answer builds on the multiple concepts taught in the module evaluating the quality of a model.  

- Partial Credit: Answer does not connect to multiple concepts of model quailty.

- No Credit: No answer provided

Question 10:

- Full Credit: Plot with year on the x-axis and day of year on the y-axis. The regression line is included.  Axes labeled.  Uses ggplot and correct geoms

- Partial Credit: Plot has incorrect axes values, labels, did not use ggplot, incorrect geom, no regression line, or other issues

- No Credit: No plot provided

Question 11:   

- Full Credit:  Correct calculation of the ice-off day in 2040, 90% confidence intervals, and answers the question about how wide the confidence interval is.

- Partial Credit:  Incorrect calculation of the ice-off day in 2040, Incorrect calculation 90% confidence intervals, or does not answers the question about how wide the confidence interval is.

- Partial Credit:  Incorrect calculation of the ice-off day in 2040, Incorrect calculation of 90% confidence intervals, and does not answers the question about how wide the confidence interval is.

- No Credit: no answer provided.

Question 12:

- Full Credit: Code, text, and plots provides an analysis that clearly uses the tidyverse skills and concepts introduced in the module 

- Partial Credit: Minor errors or omissions in code, text, and/or plots impede interpretation of any otherwise correct analysis that uses tidyverse code. 

- Partial Credit: Major errors or omissions in code, text, and/or plots result in an incorrect analysis OR analysis does not use tidyverse code where applicable 

- Partial Credit: Code provided and includes at least one correct tidyverse function but the analysis is otherwise incorrect.

- No Credit: No code or answer provided

Quarto

-   Full Credit: HTML looks clean and nicely formatted. Plots displaying properly.

-   Partial Credit: HTML has extreme errors or formatting issues that should have been caught by a cursory review before submission

-   No Credit: No HTML submitted

GitHub

-   Full Credit: assignment found on the course GitHub, multiple commits provided, and HTML committed

-   Partial Credit: Assignment found on course GitHub, but only a single commit was provided (no evidence that the student saved and committed progress) or missing HTML on GitHub.

-   No Credit: Assignment not found on the course GitHub organization OR no commits from the student on GitHub.
